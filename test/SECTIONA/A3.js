////const is used to create constant variable
//var is used to create variables that can be changed and redeclared
//let is used to create variables that can be changed but cannot be redeclared


// variables that are declared with let can be reassigned hence no error comes up 
//while variables declared with const bring about an error hence constant variables cannot be reassigned
